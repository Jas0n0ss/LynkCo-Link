# Credits and license notices

## Receiver

OSNPlay is a derivative of [DiPlay](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay), which is itself a modified version of [xcertplay by shilapi](https://github.com/shilapi/xcertplay). The upstream receiver is licensed under GNU GPL version 3; the full text is in `LICENSE`. Upstream credits [LIVI](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI) and [Showcase](https://github.com/amineross/showcase) for protocol research. Existing source comments and attribution are preserved.

## Home and settings UI

`common/src/main/java/com/shilapi/xcertplay/DiPlayActivity.kt` adapts the palette, visual arrangement and interface copy of the [DiAuto project](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiAuto). DiAuto's source is licensed under AGPL version 3. The UI file is marked AGPL-3.0-only; its license text is included in `docs/licenses/DiAuto-AGPL-3.0.txt`.

## CarPlay icon

The unmodified icon was obtained from Apple's developer site at:

https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/carplay/carplay-96x96_2x.png

CarPlay and the CarPlay icon are Apple Inc. marks/assets. This asset is not covered by the project's open-source code license. It is used as the OSNPlay launcher icon and for in-app CarPlay artwork. Its use here does not imply Apple approval or certification.

## Native call echo cancellation

OSNPlay vendors a subset of [SpeexDSP 1.2.1](https://github.com/xiph/speexdsp/tree/SpeexDSP-1.2.1) from Xiph.org Foundation and its contributors, including the acoustic echo canceller, preprocessor and FFT/filterbank support. It is compiled into `libspeex_echo.so` for the optional experimental **Call echo cancellation** feature.

SpeexDSP uses a BSD-style three-clause license. The full copyright notices, redistribution conditions and disclaimer are retained in [the vendored COPYING file](../shared/src/main/jni/speexdsp/COPYING). Component source headers retain their additional notices, including KISS FFT's Mark Borgerding attribution. The [vendoring notes](../shared/src/main/jni/speexdsp/README.md) identify the source version and build configuration.

## Software Opus microphone encoder

OSNPlay vendors [Concentus](https://github.com/lostromb/concentus), Logan Stromberg's pure-Java port of the Opus reference library from Xiph.Org Foundation, Skype Limited, Microsoft Corporation and other contributors. It encodes the CarPlay microphone on head units whose Android has no MediaCodec Opus encoder.

Concentus uses the Opus BSD-style license. The full copyright notices, redistribution conditions and disclaimer are retained in [the vendored LICENSE file](../shared/src/main/java/org/concentus/LICENSE). The [vendoring notes](../shared/src/main/java/org/concentus/README.md) identify the source commit.

## Experimental authentication data

The public source tree, default CI artifacts and preview APKs do **not** include the accessory certificate/key pair. An optional `-standalone` release asset may contain it when the maintainer explicitly configures the authentication secret. A locally built standalone APK may bundle an explicitly supplied pair recovered from public Carlinkit firmware; those data are not Apple-issued credentials for OSNPlay and are not relicensed as project source code. Anyone who possesses such an APK can extract the pair. Its continued acceptance and suitability for general distribution are unresolved. The separate Android APK-signing key is never distributed.

## BYD HUD maneuver icons

Required Notice: Copyright AndyShaman (https://github.com/AndyShaman/BYDMate)

The maneuver PNGs under `shared/src/main/assets/byd-hud-icons` were imported from BYDMate. Its PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 terms and required notice are included alongside the assets. These files are separate from the project code license; upstream describes them as donor assets and their original provenance is not independently established. The validated DiLink 5.1 windshield path uses factory turn codes rather than these images. OSNPlay does not target BYD HUD firmware.
